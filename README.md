This is still a work in progres so there are some bugs on the appearance. Works best with border theme.

- Go back to Appearance.
- Find CSS snippets section (usually on the bottom).
- Click on the folder icon and paste the theme.css file in there.
- Turn theme on.
- You may need to reload app.
    - CTRL+ P and find Reload app without saving.
